# twitter-conspiracies
I am exploring how conspiracy theories propagate on twitter and these are some of the files I am using to aid my research. Specifically, you will find the files I use to scape and clean my data as well as the data I have collected so far. Please email tskow@princeton(dot)edu for question on data, or additional files I might be able to provide you with. 

This data set reflects the collection of over 800,000 tweets between October 1 2020 and February 1 2021. The goal with the collection of this data is to uncover trends, patterns and the nature of the propagation of conspiracy theories on Twitter. Conspiracy theories and doubts towards established institutions have become ubiquitous in the modern era. Hopefully, through research, mechanisms to combat the forces that threaten to destabilize online discourse can be developed. 

In addition to the raw tweet data, the meta data of each unique user responsible for one of the 775,000 tweets is also recorded. Furthermore, the metadata of users who follow one of the users responsible for a tweet in the primary data set is also recorded (user’s with exposure to tweets of interest).Tweets were collected from Twitter’s API. Tweets were scraped using a list of seed words which were selected after consultation with researchers from Graphika Labs. In addition to the seed words acquired from Graphika Labs a handful of hashtags with more general appeal or neutral political connotations were added in order to contextualize any conspiracy theory networks and clusters that emerged from the data. The seed words are included below. The data is not evenly distributed amongst seed words. Some seed words like “obamagate” and “trump2q2q” are used infrequently while others like “flynn” are used more regularly.  

The vast majority of tweets were published between October 1 and January 1. Twitter allows users to scrape 5,000 tweets from their historical archives each month, thus approximately 20,000 (<5%) tweets in the data set were sampled between December 2017 to January 1 2021.
